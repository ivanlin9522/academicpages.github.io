ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ This is Yifan Lin, first year PhD student majoring in Operations Research. Currently I am at H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Tech. My research interest lies in the interface of simulation and optimization, with a current focus on input uncertainty in simulation optimization. I am honored to be advised by Prof. Enlu Zhou.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I received my B.Econ in Financial Engineering and B.S. in Computer Science from Wuhan University, China, in 2017. I also received my M.S. in Operations Research from Columbia University, advised by Prof. Henry Lam.
